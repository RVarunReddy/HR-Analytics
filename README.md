With the emergence of HR Analytics in organizations; gathering, interpreting, and measuring of HR data has become easy. It acts as a tool which is a combination of statistical techniques that enable the collection, interpretation, measurement, and forecasting of data. It enlightens solutions to organizational problems and makes accurate decisions. HR Analytics provides various opportunities to businesses as forecast workforce requirements enable HR to achieve corporate goals and improve organizational performance which helps businesses in finding success. In this project, I tried to visualize the retrenchment rate and promotion rate in a company.
